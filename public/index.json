I\u0026rsquo;m assuming that it is related to the default settings so I will have to explore that! In the mean time, panic! But not really.\n Solution: turning draft=false in the markdown headers allowed the site to be present again. This could be due to the fact that i\u0026rsquo;m currently in developer mode so that way it\u0026rsquo;s not focusing on pages that are meant for deployment? Not sure - will need to conduct some thorough reserach on this?\nFollow Up: Look into why this matters?
